      <h2 class="dark:text-white">1. Project Background</h2>
      <p>
        Thellio is an IoT (Internet of Things) SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) for
        business owners so that they can get better control of their business.
        Thellio tracks business health and productivity and allows efficiency
        optimization of your connected products and machines.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before, Thellio had a quite scattered design due to limited investment
          in UX and UI design. This also led to us building quite some ‚Äúdesign
          debt‚Äù over time
        </li>
        <li>
          One solution to this was to invest in building a more robust UI design
          and UI Component Library, that matched better with Thellio‚Äôs brand
          intent
        </li>
        <li>
          It has also been a way to explore how we can create more of a ‚Äúwow
          factor‚Äù for the visual aspects of Thellio
        </li>
        <li>
          I worked as an experience designer and UI designer on this project,
          together with the rest of the Thellio development team
        </li>
        <li>
          The majority of the UI design work happened between May 2021 - October
          2021.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="dark:text-white">2. UI Component Inventory</h2>
      <p>
        Since there already was a product in place, a good starting point was to
        do a so-called UI component inventory.
        <br /><br />
        This was done by going through both the current Thellio implementation as
        well as a visionary Thellio demo. All similar components were grouped.
        <br /><br />
        The UI component inventory was then used as a basis to see what UI components
        and interactions we needed to support to roll out a new UI design.
        <br /><br />
        <strong class="dark:text-white">Some of the learnings included:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong class="dark:text-white">
            The current state of the design had been developed ad-hoc and
            introduced feature-by-feature
          </strong> (and changed along the way, depending on the feedback).
        </li>
        <li>
          A lot of the design was a mix of both ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù material design /
          Material-UI components, mixed with templates
        </li>
        <li>
          There was a <strong class="dark:text-white"
            >lack of coherence and consistency</strong
          > in terms of design fundamentals (e.g. colours, typography, spacing)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <H2WithSubtitle
        subtitle="Minimize the number of design decisions."
        title="3. Design Fundamentals"
      />
      <p>
        A logical next step was to go back to the very basics and building
        blocks of UI design. To me, this is the very foundation of UI design. If
        the colours, typography, icons, illustrations and spacing are well-
        designed, it is much easier to design individual design components. This
        is also a way to minimize the number of needed design decisions, which
        ultimately saves time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this project, there already was a basic branding in place, however,
        that branding had more accounted for print design than UI design and
        needed to be expanded upon. A good example was the colours - in the
        original brand design, there were 5 colours to pick from. However, when
        you work with UI design you tend to need a lot of variations of each
        colour to be able to design a UI that really works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, most of the original brand colours did not meet
        accessibility requirements (WCAG AA) and needed to be expanded upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also decided to see what I could reuse from material design since the
        project was implemented in material UI and switching the framework
        completely would not be feasible given the project timeframe.
      </p>
      <H2WithSubtitle
        subtitle="Change hundreds of screens with one click."
        title="4. Components"
      />
      <p>
        After defining the design fundamentals, I continued with the UI
        components and UI patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used an atomic design approach, meaning that I started by building
        blocks like buttons. Then, I used the same button design/definition
        across all components that had buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, when I decide to update the master style of Thellio‚Äôs primary button
        design, this will cascade across all other design components that use
        instances of the same primary button. This is very helpful to roll out
        design changes that impact a lot of screens.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also tried to account for various states as much as possible (e.g.
        empty states, loading states, error states, on hover).
      </p>
      <H2WithSubtitle
        subtitle="A single source of truth for designers and developers."
        title="5. Development Support and Collaboration"
      />
      <p>
        When I introduce a new design, it typically goes through a few steps
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Discuss design ideas with the development team and check if we already
          have any similar components today.
        </li>
        <li>
          Design a new component and its various states (e.g. default, on hover,
          disabled, empty).
        </li>
        <li>
          Use and test components in their context of use. For more complex
          components, e.g. the graph above, I usually do a quick coding
          prototype to see how the component will behave (and as a possible
          basis for implementation).
        </li>
        <li>
          Document all states and behaviour for each component (both interaction
          design and UI design), including e.g. responsive design behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>Upload impacted screens and components to Zeplin.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Zeplin has been an extremely helpful tool to make sure that the
        implementation follows the design. It also helps us maintain and keep
        all design aspects in sync between design and implementation. For
        instance, we learnt that it‚Äôd be best to use a different colour naming
        to better keep implementation and design in sync at all times.
      </p>
      <H2WithSubtitle
        subtitle="What I learned from this project."
        title="6. Feedback and Results"
      />
      <p>
        This was a super fun project for me. Since this was a project focused on
        mainly UI design I got to explore a lot of in-depth design decisions for
        purely visual aspects.
      </p>
      <p>We now have:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A UI Design which is closely aligned to Thellio‚Äôs brand values.</li>
        <li>
          Shorter design and implementation lead time due to more consistent
          usage of colours, fonts, spacing, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The feedback has been very positive from stakeholders.</p>
      <p>
        One of the biggest takeaways for me personally has been to <strong
          class="dark:text-white"
        >
          not underestimate the power of UI design
        </strong>. Even if it might just feel like ‚Äúcolours‚Äù and ‚Äúfonts‚Äù when
        starting out, there is so much more to it. Putting it all together
        really has a huge impact, and I feel that we can now say that Thellio is
        much closer to the visual language we want to convey.

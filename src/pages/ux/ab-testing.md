A/B testing is a powerful method for optimizing user experience by comparing two versions of a webpage or app.

First step before any A/B testing is to gather qualitative user feedback through e.g. User interviews. What's working and what's not?

From there, you might get feedback such as "The navigation is kind of bland".

So your hypothesis could be, if we redesign the navigation, we might get longer user session times.

To test this hypothesis, Google Optimize could be helpful.

Google Optimize is linked to Google Analytics.
You can also install a Google Optimize snippet (see the video, about 1.10 into it)

The video also shows how to do a few variants directly in code :)
